# DOYPAColors 0.0.2

## Major Updates

- **Palette Classification**: Palettes are now categorized into three types: **sequential**, **diverging**, and **qualitative**. This classification helps you choose the most suitable palette for your data visualization needs using the `type` argument.

- **Updated Arguments**: The `ramp` argument has been replaced with `gradient` for more intuitive control over color interpolation.

- **Enhanced Preview Plots**: The preview plots have been redesigned to provide a more comprehensive visualization of the available palettes. You can now better explore and compare palettes with updated plot types.

- **Colorblind-Friendly Palettes**: Introduced a dedicated section for colorblind-friendly palettes, making it easier to select palettes that are accessible to all viewers. We need to continue expanding this collection.

## Other Changes

- **Improved Documentation**: Updated the README and vignette with detailed usage examples and instructions on how to apply and customize palettes.
